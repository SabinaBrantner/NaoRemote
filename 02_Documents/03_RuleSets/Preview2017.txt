Hi Peter.

We're glad to hear you plan to submit an application for RoboCup 2017.
Regarding your questions, we plan to release the rulebook and the call
for participation on November 1, 2016.
Applications will be due on December 1st.  The application requirements will
likely be similar to 2016, but we plan to add limitations on the extent of
code used from other teams.

We have not published any preview of rule changes for 2016.
The changes will be relatively minor for 2017, as many teams are still
handling seeing the black and while ball introduced in 2016.  However, we
will be using artificial grass (similar to what was used in the 2016 Outdoor
Competition) and natural lighting will become more of a factor (as we will
likely either be next to windows or in an arena with natural lighting).

Best regards,
- Katie
